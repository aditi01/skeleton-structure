/* 1. Not all the template engines work uniformly with express, hence this library in js, (consolidate), is used to 
make the template engines work uniformly. Altough it doesn't have any modules of its own and any template engine to 
be used should be seprately installed!

/*2. Handlebars is a library in js, which is a template engine. In this code we use handlebars to declare variables
 in the HTML page of this code and defining its value in the routes.js.*/
